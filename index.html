				<hr>
				
				<div class="fade-up col-md-6">
					<p>This whole place is a mountain
						when you roam around this place you will realize
						below 4-5 inch depth, there's no soil, only stones
						the slope of this place is nearly 40 degree
						but still trees & shrubs now grow so profusely that we need to cut them
						How did it happen?
						Never plowed your land using a tractor, the destroyer of nature
						Now you'll say, I've understood the theory enough
						but how do we do all this
						I tell you it is not rocket science. It is very simple
						Don't think it is something very very difficult
						Let the water percolate down under the earth
						It is called rainwater harvesting
						In every village of India, even from Iran till Sri Lanka
						in each village, there used to be artificial lakes according to Vastu
						Observe, 5 meters away from this point till..
						... till here it is stone
						It is all hilly stones.
						If you dug little deeper under the earth after 4-6 inches there's no soil
						Total soil depth is just this much length of my hand
						This place has turned green because there's rainwater that's allowed to percolate down
						How the rainwater percolates down, I will show you</p>
				</div><!-- col-md-6 -->
				
				<div class="fade-up col-md-6">
					<p> 
						
						wherever you put your hand it is all stones
						Look.. it is all stones & pebbles
						So, what we should do, we should conserve water
						dug wells
						make ponds to conserve rainwater
						for 1-2 years you've to maintain and then it can sustain on its own
						200 meters ahead there's a borewell
						from 10-12 years it was dry
						for 4 years rainwater percolated down the borewell got recharged
						there are 3 rules for water to percolate down under the earth
						first, slow down the flowing water
						let the water spread
						then let it seep under the earth
						if the water runoff speed is high then it doesn't seep inside
						such water takes away upper fertile soil & causes erosion
						when water is slowed down, it spreads & seeps through small holes & cracks
						it will refill the aquifers under the earth
						and next time more & more water will percolate down
						when more water seeps down..
						.. then this jungle comes up automatically
						when you go around this place you'll observe how we've made the trenches
						the runoff rainwater flows in multiple directions because of the slope of the mountain
						water goes in all directions
						but, we've designed the trenches that all the water flows into them
						stones & objects are so placed that the speed of runoff water slows down by the time it reaches the trenches
						water spreads then slows down & then sink into the earth
						this trench is 3 feet deep
						the soil from this trench is put on the downward edge of the trench to prevent overflow of water
						we've 12 such trenches
						whatever greenery you see around,
						grasses, shrubs, jungles
						all this came after October 2013
						This is the 5th year after adopting permaculture. We experienced 5th rainfall this year
						if it rains heavily for 3-4 hours continuously then this big trench fills up till brim
						and water remains in the trench for like a month
						it means that there's more empty space under the earth for water to seep in

				<div class="fade-up col-md-6">
					<p>Gravitation indicates Soil It is called "Living Soil". In a fistful soil, there are living organisms more than human beings on earth These living organisms make the soil fertile. When we press the soil hard, all the organisms in the soil die, a soil without living organisms is like cement. <br> Do not burn anything in the farm</p>
				</div><!-- col-md-6 -->
				
				<div class="fade-up col-md-6">
					<p>Do you know how brick is made?
						<br>
						<br>
						Soil is processed and it is burnt in a kiln, then it becomes brick . If you put water & fertilizer in brick will a plant grow in it, it won't. Every year after harvesting your crops, like wheat & cotton etc. If you burn down the residue then organisms living up till 4-5 mm depth die Every year farmers burn the residue 3 times After burning residue, farmers put water. They think it is potash. Then they plow with tractors. The deeper soil is brought on top. Farmers harvest in this soil & then repeat the same crop burning & tractor plowing. When you repeat this process 4-5 times, know that 1 foot of soil has become like a brick. Soil would have become brick in the first time, but tractor's pressure breaks it. Now they put urea & other chemicals to make the soil fertile But can plants grow there?</p>

				<h1 class="fade-down centered">3. Pest Control</h1>
				<hr>
				
				<div class="fade-up col-md-6">
					<p>If you're so scared of diseases, then notice in earlier times marigold used to be planted next to field
						<br>
						Marigold flowers act like mentors. They take all the pests (problems) on themselves
						so that pests don't infect the crop. Plants like marigold are also called pest attractor. Instead of pesticides, plant pest-attractors 80-90% of pests who were going to attack main crops like cauliflower would go to the marigold. Marigold hardly took 1/2 inch space. When marigold matures more pests from surroundings will come on it. Or else plant Tulsi (Holy basil) around your farm .
						
						 </p>
				</div><!-- col-md-6 -->
				
				<div class="fade-up col-md-6">
					<p>Plant onion or garlic. They take 1/2 inch space
						Have you ever observed insects in onion or garlic plants?
						No insects, why? Because these plants release a foul smell that detracts the pests
						We all know these small tricks but still, we don't practice.
						No insects are found in Tusli (Holy basil)
						Why, because, 24 hours Tulsi plant releases oxygen
						That's why in Indian tradition Tusli plant is worshipped
						There's a plant called Chives. It smells like garlic
						nothing grows in roots, unlike garlic
						but, leaves give same smell as garlic
						<br>
						<br>
						Aloe vera also releases a lot of oxygen
						thus doesn't attract pests
						We've experimented all this on our farm
						If you roam around in our farm you'll hardly find any pests
						If you do find pests then know that earth was never bereft of pests.
						<br>
						<br>
						If 80% of your crop survives, then I feel it is a success

						This "joint family", so many plants are growing together

						And look from this less than 1-inch space 3 ginger plants are coming up
						The roots have not gone down. They spreading horizontally
						Small-small roots are all spreading horizontally

						Here we've planted Papaya recently
						This is Gongura. Andhra people like it a lot in their curries
